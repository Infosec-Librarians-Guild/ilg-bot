# ILG Discord Bot 

This repository contains the code for the [Infosec Librarians Guild](https://infoseclib.com) Discord Bot.

## Contributing

We encourage contributions to this bot, so please feel free to fork, upgrade, test(!!!!), and PR content as you wish!
The bot does not currently use a DB or any kind of back end, so setup consists of creating a file called `config/secret.json` with the following configuration:
```
{
	"token":"DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"
}
```
The bot can then be run in a dev server as desired.
